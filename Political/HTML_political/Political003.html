        <h3>Yahya Sinwar has disappeared. Hardly surprising when thousands of Israeli troops backed by drones, electronic eavesdropping devices and human informants, are all trying to discover his whereabouts.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sinwar, who has striking snow-white hair and jet-black eyebrows, is the leader of Hamas's political wing in Gaza, and one of Israel's most wanted men.</li>
            <li>It holds him responsible along with others for the 7 October raid into southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, and more than 200 others kidnapped.</li>
            <li>"Yahya Sinwar is the commanderâ€¦ and he is a dead man," declared the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari in early October.</li>
            <li>"This abominable attack was decided upon by Yahya Sinwar," said IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. "Therefore he and all those under him are dead men walking."</li>
            <li>That includes Mohammed Deif, the elusive leader of Hamas's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.</li>
            <li>Hugh Lovatt, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), believes Deif was the brains behind the planning of the 7 October attack because it was a military operation, but Sinwar "would likely have been part of the group that planned and influenced it".</li>
            <li>Israel believes that Sinwar, who is effectively second-in-command after Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, is cornered below ground, hiding in tunnels somewhere beneath Gaza with his bodyguards, communicating with no-one for fear that his signal will be tracked and located.</li>
        </ul>
