        At the end of its final policy meeting of the year, the Federal Reserve is on Wednesday expected to leave US interest rates unchanged <br>
          as officials grow increasingly optimistic over the chances of a soft landing.The Fed has raised interest rates by 525 basis points since <br>
           March 2022 after an inflation surge in the US, bringing rates to their current target range of between 5.25 and 5.50 per cent. <br> <br>
The Fed wanted to slow the economy without steering it into a recession, which is otherwise known as a soft landing. <br>
Recent government data shows that scenario is within view, opening the possibility that the Fed is finished raising rates in this cycle.

  <p>Now, the conversation has shifted to when the US central bank will cut rates, and by how much. <br>

    After a hotter-than-expected inflation report on Tuesday, traders anticipate the first rate cut will arrive in May 2024. <br>
    
    Markets will be closely monitoring Fed chairman Jerome Powell's remarks for clues on the path forward after the central bank's <br>
     2pm (ET) announcement. The Fed will also update its economic projections, offering further clues on future decisions and estimations. <br>
     Since the Fed has begun its aggressive tightening campaign, inflation has fallen considerably from 9.1 per cent to its <br>
     current 3.1 per cent. But it is still well above the Fed's long-term 2 per cent goal. <br>

     Those two reports have led traders to push back their projections on the first rate cut from March to May. <br>

     As he has been in his public remarks, Mr Powell will try to remain as tight-lipped as possible on future Fed decisions. <br>
     
     Instead, he could continue to rely on a familiar refrain he has used in recent meetings, which is to maintain a careful <br>
     approach moving forward.</p>
