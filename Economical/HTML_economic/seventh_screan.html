        Masdar City will pivot more into the realm of net-zero projects in the coming years,  <br>
        its director of growth has said.“If we didn’t see imitators, that would be a bad thing,” Steve Severance <br>
        told The National in an interview at Cop28 climate summit in Dubai, referring to the<br> UAE’s sustainable community, 
        business free zone and technology hub, which was first announced in 2007.<br><br>
Fast-forward to 2023, Mr Severance noted that many new communities and building projects often tout <br>
their green credentials. However, Masdar City was among the first to walk the walk in terms<br>
 of making it happen, he said.From net-zero buildings springing up to solar and geothermal projects generating<br>
  power, Masdar City, part of Abu Dhabi's clean energy company Masdar, has seen many of the sustainability<br>
   developments that led to its creation. <br>
   “How do we stay at the forefront?” Mr Severance asked during an interview for The National’s <br>
   Business Extra podcast.<br><br>
“We’re going from reducing consumption and showcasing those buildings to emphasising net <br> 
zero and saying we are at the point where we can achieve widespread, wide-scale net zero,”<br> 
 he said, referring to Masdar City already housing the world’s largest collection of LEED <br> 
 Platinum buildings, the highest certification provided by the Leadership in Energy and <br> 
 Environmental Design programme.<br> 
 During the UN summit, Masdar City also announced plans for a net-zero mosque, said to be <br>
 a first for the region, that will have a capacity for 1,300 worshippers and run on 100 per <br>
 cent solar energy.<br><br>

“We’re not just doing residences or offices … we’re doing a place of worship because of the <br>
importance they play globally,” Mr Severance said.<br>

For Masdar City, sustainability projects must tick environmental, social and economic boxes,<br>
 he said.“It’s key to what our mission is," Mr Severance said, referring to the net-zero mosque.<br>
  "We need to be sustainable in all areas and that's what this will do."<br>
Last November, Gems Education, one of the UAE’s prominent education groups, <br>
announced plans to launch a net-zero school in Masdar City as well.<br>

In 2021, the UAE announced its Net Zero by 2050 plan outlining Dh600 billion <br>
($163.38 billion) worth of investment in clean and renewable energy sources in the <br>
next three decades.<br><br>
