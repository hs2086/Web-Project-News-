        <h3>Michael Gove admits councils are facing significant pressures</h3>
        <h3>He says warning that one in five are on brink is overestimate</h3>
        <h3>The UK government has drawn up a “watch list” of local authorities that are on the brink of <br>
           financial collapse and acknowledged that a funding shortfall is causing “significant” strain <br>
           on many councils.<br>
    
          Michael Gove, the UK’s secretary of state for leveling up, distanced the <br>central government from the growing crisis after cuts to real terms funding <br>
          for councils since 2010, saying that the troubles were largely linked to mismanagement. <br>
          <h2>Local councils in England at risk of insolvency over £3bn funding black hole</h2>

          <h3>More councils could be at risk of insolvency over the coming months as local authorities in England struggle to  <br>
            fill a £3bn funding black hole  caused by inflationary costs and soaring demand for services, town hall leaders have said. <br>
             According to the Local Government Association (LGA), severalcouncils are in “an endgame” where, without an increase in funding,  <br>
             they face the prospect of taking increasingly drastic action to meet their legal  duty to balance the books.The cost of <br>
              providing current levels of council services over the next few months is set to exceed existing available funding <br>
               by at least £2bn, and by nearly £1bn next year, the LGA said, because of high wage and fuel inflation. <br>
               Should inflation stubbornly fail to drop in line with the government’s March budget forecasts, and instead match recent <br>
                Bank of England inflation projections, it would add an extra £740m to council costs this financial year, and an extra £1.5bn <br>
                in 2024-25, it said.Pete Marland, the chair of the LGA’s resources board, said that while recent council insolvencies such as Thurrock, <br>
                 Croydon,   Woking and Slough were characterised by governance failures, even well-run councils were “at risk of coming to the end <br>
                  of the road” financially. After 13 years of cuts, councils were now reaching the point where there was no more room to reduce  <br>
                  statutory services, and no financial reserves left to fill budget gaps. “We will start to see more and more councils starting to  <br>
                  declare virtual bankruptcy because they can’t cut services any further,” Marland said. Several councils have only been able to <br>
                   sign off their books for 2022-23 by drawing down one-off, multimillion-pound lump sums running into millions of pounds <br>
                from reserves. While this keeps them afloat for now, it leaves them vulnerable should they be unable to cut costs in the coming  <br>
                months. “We are in an endgame where, unless something changes in the medium- to long-term funding settlement, we start to see more <br>
                 and more councils taking more drastic action,” Marland told the FT. <br>
                 The financial warnings came as the first Labour chair of the LGA for nearly nine years addressed the conference. <br>
                  Shaun Davies, 37, the Leader of Telford and Wrekin council and the youngest ever LGA chair, called for a new local deal for <br>
                  councils – to stabilise town hall services.He said: “Simplify our funding, cut out wasteful and unnecessary bidding for resources,<br>
                   and give us long-term certainty and stability. With this we can get on with working to improve people’s lives in our villages, towns <br>
                   and cities.”Davies said councils faced a wave of homelessness from late August after about 8,000 Afghan individuals and families had been <br>
                   served notice to leave the bridging hotels they had been put up in. “We are at crisis point,” he said.
