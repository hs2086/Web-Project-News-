        US consumer prices eased slightly in November, although underlying price pressures are likely to cool any <br>
        hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut US interest rates early next year.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose <br>
        0.1 per cent last month, the LabourDepartment reported on Tuesday. On an annual basis, inflation rose 3.1 <br>
        per cent, down from 3.2 per cent in October.Falling petrol costs, which declined by 6.0 per cent, contributed to<br>
         last month's slowdown, the Labour Department said. The index for <br>
       food also slightly cooled, rising 0.2 per cent last month after a 0.3 per cent gain in October.<br>
         But price pressures remain, as evidenced by core inflation. Excluding food and energy, inflation rose 0.3 per<br>
          cent last month after rising 0.2 per cent in October. Core CPI rose 4.0 per cent annually, unchanged from October.<br>
The shelter index – which rose 0.4 per cent last month – offset the decline in petrol that the US experienced.<br>
The indexes for rent and motor vehicle insurance also increased, while goods such as apparel and household furnishings decreased.<br>
