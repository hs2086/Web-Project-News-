        Opec has stuck to its oil demand growth forecast for 2023 and 2024 and expects “resilient” <br>
        gross domestic product growth globally to support crude demand next year.<br><br>

Global oil demand growth forecast for this year was unchanged from last month’s estimate at 2.5 million <br>
barrels per day, the group said in its monthly oil market report on Wednesday.<br><br>

In 2024, oil demand is expected to grow by 2.2 million bpd, supported by improving economic activity in China.<br>

“Continuous improvements in economic activity, steady manufacturing and transportation activity <br>
mostly in China, other Asia and the Middle East, as well as in India and Latin America, are<br>
 expected to account for the bulk of oil consumption,” Opec said.<br><br>
 The group raised its forecast for world economic growth to 2.9 per cent for 2023, but left its growth<br>
  estimate for the coming year unchanged at 2.6 per cent.<br><br>

Opec’s crude production in November dropped by 57,000 bpd, compared with the previous month, to 27.84 million bpd.<br>

On November 30, the Opec+ alliance announced voluntary production cuts of 2.2 million bpd <br>
for the first quarter of 2024.<br>

Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will keep its voluntary output cut of one <br>
million bpd until the end of March.<br><br>
Russia is expected to deepen its voluntary oil production cut to 500,000 bpd and <br>
extend it until the end of the first quarter of 2024.<br><br>

The cuts came in response to a fall in oil prices.<br>

Brent crude, which briefly touched $98 in September, has since lost nearly a fifth of its<br>
 value despite predictions of a tight crude market in the fourth quarter by the International<br>
  Energy Agency and Opec.
  <br>
China’s growth trajectory, supported by further government-led stimulus measures, could support <br>
global economic growth in the short term, Opec said.<br>

The country has announced a string of measures over the past few months as weak consumption and<br>
 a property sector slump hinder growth in the world’s second-largest economy.<br>

Meanwhile, “sustained” momentum in the US in the fourth quarter and throughout 2024 could lead to<br>
 economic growth surpassing initial expectations, the oil producers group added.<br>

In October, the International Monetary Fund kept its global economic growth projection for this year at<br>
 3 per cent, slower than the 3.5 per cent expansion recorded in 2022, remaining below the historical <br>
 growth average.<br>

For 2024, the fund expects global GDP to expand by 2.9 per cent, a 0.1 percentage point downgrade<br>
 from the forecast made by the fund in July for the same period.<br>
