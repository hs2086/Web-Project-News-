        <h1>UK’s Economy Shrinks in October, Signaling Weak End to Year</h1>
        
            <h3>First time since July all three main sectors of economy shrank</h3>
            <h3>Wet weather and half term break contributed to the drop</h3>

        <p>The UK economy shrank more than expected in October as elevated borrowingcosts and wet weather took their toll,  <br>
            setting the stage for another quarter of stagnation that is widely forecast to persist through 2024. <br>

            Gross domestic product fell 0.3% following a gain of 0.2% in September,  <br>
            the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. The drop was the first since July and exceeded <br>
             the 0.1% fall economists had forecast. <br>
             <h2>Resilience and fiscal support to fade as monetary drag kicks in</h2>
             <h3>Milton Friedman said monetary policy acts with “long and variable lags.”<br>
                 We think the same can also be said of fiscal policy. Economic resilience this year owed much to fiscal support,<br>
                 with the U.S. deficit widening and with households having ample savings from pandemic-related stimulus.</h3>

                 U.S. fiscal policy will turn contractionary, while recent elevated inflation erodes the real value of wealth,<br>
                  including the excess savings accumulated as a result of government payments to households during the pandemic. <br>
                  Our analysis suggests that household liquid assets built up during the pandemic (see Figure 1) will likely deplete in <br>
                   real terms over our cyclical horizon. while recent elevated inflation erodes the real value of wealth, including <br>

                          fiscal support may also be constrained due to high debt levels and the role of post-pandemic stimulus in fueling inflation. <br>

                          Additionally, households and businesses have extended the maturity of their debts, resulting in a more gradual <br> pass-through of rising interest rates. Central banks’ significant purchases of <br>fixed income assets mean that governments are also absorbing a larger share of recent bond price losses. <br>
                          Still, we believe economic weakness is coming. We expect unemployment to rise next year,<br> leading to a normalization of central bank rates back toward neutral levels.

                        Growth and inflation have peaked
                     </h1> <p>
                        The global economy, led by the U.S., has shown remarkable resilience despite one of the most rapid tightening cycles in modern history, raising questions about the <br> effectiveness of monetary policy.
We discussed whether monetary policy lags might be longer as a result of the pandemic and the related policy response, or whether more tightening is needed, perhaps because the neutral real long-run <br>policy rate has risen. (That neutral rate, or r*, is the estimated interest rate that over time is consistent with the economy operating at capacity and target inflation.)

Our view is that it is mostly a lag. We believe growth has peaked. We expect resilience to turn into weakness as growth slows later this year and into 2024. <br>

Fiscal headwinds – especially in the U.S. – will soon come into play. We think that monetary policy is still working, as evident in a clear slowing in credit growth and a meaningful tightening in bank lending standards. <br>
We believe inflation has peaked as well. In most DM economies, both headline and core inflation have decreased from their highs, albeit at different rates. Sticky wage inflation is likely to support core inflation longer unless there is some weakness in the labor market. We forecast core inflation in the 2.5%–3% area in the U.S. <br>
and Europe at the end of 2024. We anticipate that falling growth and rising unemployment will lead to more disinflation, helped also by other factors (for more, please see our Viewpoint, “Fiscal Arithmetic and the Global Inflation Outlook”).

<h1> A soft landing would be an anomaly</h1>
<p>It’s worth noting the historical rarity of central banks achieving a soft landing – or avoiding a recession – when inflation is <br>
     high at the start of a cycle.We analyzed 140 tightening cycles across developed markets from the 1960s through today. When central <br>
     banks hiked policy rates by 400 basis points (bps) or more – as several have done this cycle, including the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed),<br>
      the European Central Bank (ECB), and the BOE – almost all such instances ended in recession.Notably, better economic outcomes<br>
       in the face of past hiking cycles were often associated with supply expansion. The post-pandemic supply-chain normalization could<br>
        help here, as well as a possible AI-fueled productivity boom. However, it’s yet to be seen how much these factors contribute to boosting <br>
        productivity over our cyclical horizon.Healthy starting conditions for household and corporate balance sheets, as well as proactive <br>
        financial stability policies – think of the BOE’s intervention in the LDI crisis, or the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation<br>
         quickly extending bank guarantees under exceptional circumstances earlier this year – could be another source of assistance. These policies<br>
          have so far successfully thwarted a recession.<br>But history suggests that tight financial conditions create a high risk of financial market accidents,<br>
           and there are areas of vulnerability within markets, such as in private credit, commercial real estate, and bank loans.<br>
    There are also risks related to China. The country’s recovery has been weaker than expected, weighed down by the property market. Housing investment,<br>
     which had been expected to stabilize, is down 7.5% year-over-year as of August, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics.<br>
    More stimulus is likely needed to stabilize China's property sector and the economy more broadly. There are risks if stimulus is insufficient<br>
     or too slow to arrive. In a downside scenario, growth could further decelerate in 2024 (to 3%, versus our current baseline of 4.4%).<br>
      This would suppress China’s demand for global goods and services, weighing on the global economy.<br>
       The government still has the capacity and tools to avoid such a downside scenario. We expect continued policy easing to support growth.
     More fiscal supports, including a wider central government deficit and higher local government special bond issuance,<br>
      could help lift domestic demand via infrastructure capital spending or tax cuts. We believe further reduction to China’s policy rate,<br>
       currently at 2.65%, is likely. The government has recently called for more countercyclical macro policies to prevent the economy <br>
       from sharp deceleration.</p>
