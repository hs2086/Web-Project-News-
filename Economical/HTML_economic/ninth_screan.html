        At Cop28, green hydrogen has featured prominently in talks about renewable energy. <br>
         As discussions veer towards embracing cleaner energy sources, the African continent is poised <br>
         to become the world’s leading green hydrogen producer.<br><br>

    Africa has the potential to generate a trillion dollars’ worth of green hydrogen by 2035. <br>
    As hydrogen's rising role in the global energy transition meets Africa’s growing supply capacity, <br>
    maritime highways are being formed to transport this climate-smart energy carrier from Africa to Europe and Asia.<br>

European and Asian nations have already made multibillion-dollar commitments to green hydrogen strategies<br>
 to achieve energy transition, and they are now looking to Africa as one of the main suppliers.<br>
  Africans themselves are eyeing the continent’s potential to power their own development and regard <br>
  exports as a means of developing renewable energy infrastructure that will also serve domestic needs.<br>

Why has green hydrogen risen to prominence as a component of the global energy transition? For one, <br>
it differs from conventional industrial hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas, emitting large volumes <br>
of carbon dioxide and earning the label “grey” hydrogen.<br><br>

When a carbon capture mechanism is used, the resulting lower carbon footprint hydrogen is termed “blue” hydrogen.<br>
 Instead of using natural gas, green hydrogen is produced by using electricity generated from renewable sources to <br>
 split water into its hydrogen and oxygen components, creating a virtually carbon-free (hence, “green”) energy carrier.<br>
  Reversing the process in a fuel cell by recombining green hydrogen and oxygen back into water generates electric <br>
  current, providing on-demand, climate-smart power.<br> <hr>

  The most cost-effective way to store and transport green hydrogen is in the form of green ammonia. <br>
   Since ammonia is a basic input for fertiliser production <br> (70 per cent of global ammonia consumption <br>
    is for fertilisers) there is already demand for green ammonia. <br> <br>
    The importance of making fertiliser with natural gas-free ammonia became clear   when Covid-19-related <br>
     supply shocks in 2021 caused a 400 per cent jump in European natural gas prices, which subsequently <br>
      shot up the cost of fertilisers. As gas prices skyrocketed further as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, <br>
       ammonia and fertiliser plants were shut down in the UK, Spain, France, Italy, Germany and Poland. <br>
        Understandably, Europe sees investing ingreen ammonia as a must in order to ensure resilient, <br>
         sustainable agri-food production. <br> 

Green hydrogen can also be a fuel or an electricity source for manufacturing processes,  <br>
including metals processing. In 2023, Sweden opened Europe’s first green steel production plant. <br>
 Similarly, green steel complexes are under construction in Spain, France and Germany, as well as South Korea and Japan. <br> <br>

As discussions at Cop28 have emphasised, meeting global 2050 climate targets is non-negotiable. <br> 
 It will require 6.5 billion tonnes of materials – 95 per cent of which will be steel, aluminium and copper. <br>
  In 2021, the UAE initiated the world’s first green aluminium production when Emirates Global Aluminium produced <br>
   its trademark CelestiAL aluminium using power from the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. Solar and wind <br>
    power from Africa transported as green ammonia would enable European and Asian aluminium manufacturers to do the same. <br>
     Germany’s metals giant Aurubis has started trial copper wire production powered with ammonia. <br>

Major Asian economies could turn to Africa’s green hydrogen to fuel their power plants. Already  <br>
Asia’s coal-burning regions are moving toward “co-firing”, using both ammonia and coal in coal-fired <br>
 power plants. Japan is conducting co-firing test runs with a mix of 20 per cent ammonia and 80 per cent coal. <br>

Japan eyes moving to a 50-50 mix during the 2030s on the way to phasing out coal in favour of 100 per cent <br>
 ammonia by the 2050s. Japan has signed bilateral agreements to develop an East Asian fuel ammonia ecosystem,  <br>
 including with Indonesia – which burns coal for 62.5 per cent of its power, Singapore – which aspires to be <br>
  a hydrogen trading hub, and Thailand. To decarbonise by pivoting to fuel ammonia, Asia will need to import  <br>
  African-produced green ammonia. <br> <br>

Africa’s ability to become a green hydrogen powerhouse is due primarily to its deserts. The Sahara, covering 10 nations <br>
 in North Africa and the Sahel region, possesses the world’s largest solar resources. The solar energy striking the Sahara <br>
  is 7,000 times greater than the power requirements of the EU at any given moment. Africa’s enormous solar resources  <br>
  are supplemented by vast wind power resources. <br> <br>

Morocco and Egypt are the early leaders in Africa’s drive for green hydrogen. Morocco began its development of green hydrogen <br>
 production in partnership with Germany in 2018, and it has since moved on to multiple private sector development projects, <br>
  involving investments from the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal and the EU. <br>

Its largest green ammonia project to date, the Irish-Portuguese Hevo facility, is slated to have an initial annual <br>
 capacity of 183,000 tonnes by 2026. With the country’s total production of green ammonia rising to 1 million tonnes <br>
  by 2027 and reaching 3 million tonnes by 2032, Morocco could export 1-3 million tonnes annually. <br>

  <br>Egypt, Africa’s second-largest natural gas producer, is the world’s seventh-largest producer <br>
   of conventional ammonia. Cairo aims to use part of Egypt’s solar and wind power generation capacity <br>
    to capture 5-8 per cent of the global commercial market for green hydrogen. Egypt has signed framework <br>
     agreements to build green hydrogen plants with the renewable energy subsidiary of Australia’s  <br>
     iron ore producer Fortescue along with firms in India, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, the UK and France.  <br>
     The agreement signed with a Masdar-led consortium is ambitious, committing to build two green hydrogen plants. <br>
     Mauritania is the green hydrogen powerhouse of the Sahel. Possessing solar and wind resources <br>
     similar to its North African neighbours, Mauritania’s population is seven times smaller than<br>
      Morocco and 20 times smaller than Egypt. Sparsely inhabited Mauritania can more easily serve<br>
       export markets while using the same infrastructure to provide for the needs of its own five<br>
        million citizens.<br><br>

South of the Sahel, Namibia has become Africa’s green hydrogen leader, enjoying strong German and EU support.<br>
 With 2.7 million citizens, sparsely populated Namibia, like Mauritania, can satisfy its own domestic needs<br>
  while supporting a robust export market. Firms from the UAE, Egypt, Germany, France and the UK have invested<br>
   in constructing green ammonia plants in the country while the Port of Rotterdam has already signed an MoU <br>
   with one of those Mauritanian facilities to offtake up to 600,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually.<br>

South Africa aspires to leverage its pre-existing mining export industries to develop a green hydrogen <br>
export sector, perhaps forming a southern Africa green hydrogen hub with Namibia. Centred on a cluster<br>
 of key projects, the largest is slated to produce 780,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually.<br>

In East Africa, Kenya holds the potential to lead green hydrogen exports to European and Indo-Pacific markets.<br>
 Beyond solar and wind, Kenya is the world’s seventh-largest geothermal power producer and has signed an agreement <br>
 with Fortescue’s renewable arm to create a green ammonia plant powered by geothermal energy.<br>

By 2050, global hydrogen demand is forecast to reach 500-680 million tonnes.<br>
 Global trade in hydrogen trade by 2050 is projected to generate more<br>
  than $280 billion in annual export revenues. Beyond helping to de-carbonise<br>
   the planet, African nations and their international partners leading the creation<br>
    of Africa’s green hydrogen highways to Europe and Asia will stand to reap enormous economic reward.<br>
