        Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil-producing company, has reported a 23 per cent drop in third-quarter  net<br>
         profit amid the kingdom's voluntary production cuts and a fall in crude prices.Net profit after zakat for the<br>
          three-month period to the end of September fell to 122.2 billion Saudi riyals ($32.58 billion), from 159 billion riyals <br>
          in the same period in the previous year, the state oil company said on Tuesday in a filing to the Tadawul stock exchange,<br>
           where its shares are traded.<br>
           “Our robust financial results reinforce Aramco’s ability to generate consistent value for our shareholders, and we <br>
           continue to identify new opportunities to evolve our business and meet the needs of customers,” said Aramco president<br>
            and chief executive Amin Nasser.<br>
Brent, the benchmark for two thirds of the world’s oil, surged to about $140 a barrel after the invasion of Ukraine last year,<br>
 but has since given up most of its gains due to resilient Russian crude supply and fuel demand concerns.<br>
However, the international benchmark rose by more than 22 per cent in the third quarter as Opec+ production cuts,<br>
 combined with voluntary output reductions by Saudi Arabia and Russia, tightened crude supplies.<br>
Revenue during the period also declined by 22 per cent to 424 billion riyals, Aramco said. <br>
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia said it would continue with its voluntary cut of one million barrels per day until December 2023 <br>
 amid continued volatility in the crude market due to the Israel-Gaza war.The kingdom’s production in December will be about <br>
 nine million bpd, the state-run SPA reported, citing a source from the Energy Ministry.<br>

“This voluntary cut decision will be reviewed next month to consider extending the cut, deepening <br>the cut or increasing production,”
 the source said.
Moscow will also keep in place export cuts of 300,000 bpd, which came into effect<br> in September and October, until the end of the year.

The company said its average realised crude oil prices in the third<br> quarter fell to $89.30 a barrel from $101.70 a <br>barrel in the same period a year earlier.

Under the World Bank’s baseline forecast, oil prices are projected <br>to average $90 a barrel in the current quarter before declining to an average of $81 a barrel next year amid a<br> global economic slowdown.

<br>Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs maintained its oil price forecast of $100 a barrel by June 2024<br> on supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Russia.

Swiss <br>lender UBS expects Brent crude to trade in the range of $90 to $100 a barrel over the next 12 months.<br>

Aramco, whose shares have gained about 14 per cent on the Tadawul this year, said it would pay a base <br>dividend of $19.5 billion for the third quarter.

        Its shares were up 0.3 per cent on Tuesday at 33.55 riyals. <br>

Its first performance-linked dividend distribution of $9.9 billion was paid in the third quarter and <br>
br the second distribution of about $9.9 billion will be paid in the fourth quarter based on <br>
combined full-year and nine-month results for 2022 and 2023, respectively.<br>

The dividends “reflect the bullish outlook Aramco still has, [aligning with the] voluntary cuts and <br>
intervention by Opec + members”, Mazen Salhab, chief market strategist at BDSwiss Mena, told The National.<br>
“We think that Aramco remains committed to expansion, acquisition with more diversification in energy sector <br>
despite the challenges ahead from China’s weakening demand and [the] global energy transformation,” he said.<br>
In September, Aramco signed agreements to acquire a minority stake in LNG company MidOcean Energy.<br>

Competition for LNG has increased since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, with Europe importing record<br>
 volumes of the supercooled fuel to replace Moscow's gas supplies.<br>
“During the third quarter we agreed to make our first international investment in liquefied natural gas to capitalise<br>
 on rising LNG demand, and announced our intention to enter the South American retail market,” Mr Nasser said.<br>

“These planned investments demonstrate the scale of our ambition, the broad scope of our activities <br>
and the disciplined execution of our strategy.”<br>

Aramco's capital expenditure in the third quarter rose to 41.35 billion riyals ($11.02 billion)<br>
 from 33.9 billion riyals a year earlier.Free cash flow was 76.28 billion riyals ($20.33 billion)<br>
  in the latest reported quarter, compared with 168.62 billion riyals in the third quarter of last year.<br>

The company plans to continue investing across the hydrocarbon chain and adopt technology to optimise<br>
 operations and support the development of emerging energy solutions, Mr Nasser said.<br>

“It is an approach rooted in our belief that a balanced and realistic energy transition plan should consider<br>
 the needs of all geographies, in order to avoid disparities between global energy consumers.”<br>
